## Spin Rhythm lets you play a random song from the main soundtrack. Why can't we do the same for custom charts? 
This project aims to change that. This will let you press a hotkey of your choice to start playing a new, random custom chart. It works equally as well regardless of if the game is open or not! 

## Variables you may want to change:

[`difficulty`: default is 4, which is XD](https://github.com/kylefmohr/Play_Random_SRXD_Custom/blob/18715cecb7fcff52af6da8deee4a5e7282130408/main.py#L5)

If you want expert, change it to 3

Hard, change to 2, etc. etc

[`key_to_listen_for`: by default, **it is listening for the "Home" key** on the keyboard to be pressed](https://github.com/kylefmohr/Play_Random_SRXD_Custom/blob/18715cecb7fcff52af6da8deee4a5e7282130408/main.py#L5)

You can change it to any of these:

## How to install and run

* Install Python 3 if you don't already have it https://python.org

* Download this repository as a zip file or clone

* Open a command prompt and cd to this directory


* run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

* then run `python3 main.py`

You can then simply leave that command prompt running in the background. It should work now, test it out!
